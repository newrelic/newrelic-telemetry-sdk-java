### Telemetry Core Module

This module contains the low-level APIs to send dimensional metrics and spans to New Relic.

Javadoc can be found here: [![Javadocs][javadoc-image]][javadoc-url]

Since it is intended to have minimal dependencies, it requires an HTTP implementation
in order to function. Implementation of the following interface is required:

`HttpPoster` : a very simple interface for sending an HTTP Post and returning a response.

A reference implementation based on `okhttp` is provided in the `telemetry-http-okhttp` module.
A reference implementation based on Java 11 `HttpClient` is provided in the `telemetry-http-java11` module.


If you want to consume this module as-is, it is published at the maven coordinate:
