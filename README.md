# New Relic Java Telemetry SDK 
The New Relic Java Telemetry SDK is an easy way to send data to New Relic.
The SDK currently supports sending the MELT telemetry data types 
(Metrics, Events, Logs, and Traces) 
via the following APIs:

* [Metric API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/report-metrics-metric-api) - for dimensional metrics 
* [Trace API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/trace-api/introduction-trace-api) - for building up traces with spans
* [Events API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/introduction-event-api) - for custom events
* [Log API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/log-api/introduction-log-api) - for log data

Why is this cool?

Send data to New Relic! No agent required. 

Our [Telemetry SDK](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/new-relic-sdks/telemetry-sdks-send-custom-telemetry-data-new-relic) tries to be helpful, so your job of sending telemetry data to New Relic can be done in the right way, easily. We've covered all of the basics for you so you can focus on writing feature code directly related to your business need or interest.

Why would you want to use the telemetry SDK?

We imagine you (or your customers) are interested in the telemetry data, generated by your tool, framework, or code, in New Relic. You can write an exporter to do so! Check out the [telemetry_examples](telemetry_examples) module to get started.

For the most recently published version, see [Releases](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-java/releases)

## Installation

In order to send metrics or spans to New Relic, you will need a New Relic [license key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/getting-started/intro-apis/understand-new-relic-api-keys#ingest-license-key) for the account to which you want to send data. 

Maven dependencies:

```
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.newrelic.telemetry</groupId>
      <artifactId>telemetry-core</artifactId>
      <version>0.15.0</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.newrelic.telemetry</groupId>
      <artifactId>telemetry-http-okhttp</artifactId>
      <version>0.15.0</version>
    </dependency>
```

Gradle dependencies: 

```
implementation("com.newrelic.telemetry:telemetry-core:0.15.0")
implementation("com.newrelic.telemetry:telemetry-http-okhttp:0.15.0")
```

Take a look at the example code in the [telemetry_examples](telemetry_examples) module. 
We recommend looking at the [TelemetryClientExample](telemetry_examples/src/main/java/com/newrelic/telemetry/examples/TelemetryClientExample.java)
first.

Note: If you do not want to include `okhttp` as a transitive dependency, you will need to provide a custom implementation of the
`com.newrelic.telemetry.http.HttpPoster` interface, rather than using the `com.newrelic.telemetry:telemetry-http-okhttp` library.

## Usage

### Logging
The Telemetry SDK uses slf4j for all logging. Having a slf4j implementation in your application is required in order to see log information.
See [the slf4j documentation](http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html#swapping) for details.

#### Enabling audit logging
The various builders for the Telemetry SDK components include an option to `enableAuditLogging`. Enabling this option will cause the
SDK to product additional logging at `DEBUG` level. This logging includes the details of every payload sent to the New Relic APIs, and the responses from those APIs.

*WARNING*: If you enable audit logging, all the data in your spans and metrics will be sent to your logging system. It is recommended that you only enable
audit logging when absolutely necessary.

#### Use license key
The various builders for the Telemetry SDK components include an option to `useLicenseKey`. Enabling this option will cause the SDK to inform the API endpoints the key you provided is a New Relic [license key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/getting-started/intro-apis/understand-new-relic-api-keys#ingest-license-key).

### For developers: 
#### Requirements

* Java 11 or greater
* For IDEA:
* Docker & docker-compose must be installed for integration testing

### Find and use your data

Tips on how to find and query your data in New Relic:
- [Find metric data](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/introduction-metric-api#find-data)
- [Find trace/span data](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/trace-api/introduction-trace-api#view-data)

For general querying information, see:
- [Query New Relic data](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data)
- [Intro to NRQL](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql)

## Building
CI builds are run on Github Actions: 
![build badge](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-java/workflows/main%20build/badge.svg)

The project uses Java 11 and gradle 6 for building, and the gradle wrapper is provided.

To compile, run the tests and build the jars:

`$ ./gradlew build`

## Testing

End-to-end integration tests are included. 
They are implemented with the testcontainers library; [mock-server](https://github.com/jamesdbloom/mockserver) provides the backend.

There are two modes to run the integration tests.
* Run with gradle: `$ ./gradlew integration_test:test`
* Run the integration test classes in IDEA directly. It should "just work".

## Code style
This project uses the [google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) code style, and it is 
easily applied via an included [gradle plugin](https://github.com/sherter/google-java-format-gradle-plugin):

`$ ./gradlew googleJavaFormat verifyGoogleJavaFormat`

Please be sure to run the formatter before committing any changes. There is a `pre-commit-hook.sh` which can 
be applied automatically before commits by moving it into `.git/hooks/pre-commit`.

### Module structure:

#### `telemetry_core`
This is the core module for sending dimensional metrics and spans to New Relic. It contains low level APIs as well as
 higher level "best practice" implementations that compose interactions with the lower level modules. The library is 
 published under maven coordinates:

`com.newrelic.telemetry:telemetry-core`

In order to send metrics and spans to New Relic, you will also need a New Relic [license key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/getting-started/intro-apis/understand-new-relic-api-keys#ingest-license-key) for the account to which you want to send data. 

#### `telemetry-http-java11`
This is an implementation of the required http client interface using Java 11 JDK classes as the underlying library.
The `telemetry-http-java11` library is published under the maven coordinates:

`com.newrelic.telemetry:telemetry-http-java11`

#### `telemetry-http-okhttp`
This is an implementation of the required http client interface using okhttp as the underlying library.
The `telemetry-http-okhttp` library is published under the maven coordinates:

`com.newrelic.telemetry:telemetry-http-okhttp`

#### `telemetry_examples`
Example code for using the metrics and telemetry APIs.

#### `integration_test`
Integration test module. Uses docker-compose based tests to test the SDK end-to-end.

### Retries

As [described here](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-specs/blob/master/communication.md#graceful-degradation),
the `TelemetryClient` makes use of a default backoff strategy when it encounters data ingest errors.
Specifically, this strategy tries again after 1 second, then doubles the wait after each attempt
until a max wait of 15 seconds is reached.  After 10 failed attempts, data is dropped and a message
is logged. 

The backoff strategy is not currently pluggable.  Please file an issue or submit a pull request 
if you need greater control over this behavior.

## Support

New Relic hosts and moderates an online forum where customers can interact with New Relic employees as well as other customers to get help and share best practices.
