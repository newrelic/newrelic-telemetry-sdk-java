/**
 * This class represents a response that doesn't have a 202 status code. There are 4 concrete
 * implementations of this Exception, each of which has a different recommended reaction by the
 * caller. Thrown by {@link MetricBatchSender#sendBatch(MetricBatch)}
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link RetryWithSplitException} : Thrown when the submitted batch was too large to be
 *       processed by the New Relic ingest API. The recommended course of action is to split the
 *       batch and retry with the smaller batches.
 *   <li>{@link RetryWithRequestedWaitException} : Thrown when there is a recoverable problem
 *       submitting the batch to the ingest API. The exception contains the number of seconds that
 *       the caller should wait until retrying.
 *   <li>{@link RetryWithBackoffException} : Thrown when there is a transient, recoverable problem
 *       submitting the batch to the ingest API. The recommendation is to retry the request with
 *       exponential backoff.
 *   <li>{@link DiscardBatchException} : Thrown when a there is a non-recoverable problem with
 *       submitting the batch to the ingest API. The batch should be discarded.
 * </ul>
